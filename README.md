It is understood that the probability of risk in the loan lending process by the bank is high .
Throughout the banking community, the lenders are in constant risk of a loan borrower defaulting
upon their loan . In order to minimize the risk, proper evaluation and verifications are done by the
banks to check the repaying ability of the borrower. In the machine learning world, this problem is
formulated as a supervised machine learning task in which the bank loan defaulter is predicted
automatically by training the classifiers on the historical loan data by using the machine learning
algorithms.
